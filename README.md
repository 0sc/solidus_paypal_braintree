SolidusPaypalBraintree
======================

Introduction goes here.

Installation
------------

Add solidus_paypal_braintree to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_paypal_braintree'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g solidus_paypal_braintree:install
```

Store Configuration
-------------------

This gem adds a configuration model - `SolidusPaypalBraintree::Configuration` -
that belongs to `Spree::Store` as `braintree_configuration`. In multi-store
Solidus applications, this model allows admins to enable/disable payment types
on a per-store basis.

The migrations for this gem will add a default configuration to all stores that
has each payment type disabled. It also adds a `before_create` callback to
`Spree::Store` that builds a default configuration. You can customize the
default configuration that gets created by overriding the private
`build_default_configuration` method on `Spree::Store`.

A view override is provided that adds a `Braintree` tab to the admin settings
submenu. Admins can go here to edit the configuration for each store.

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs, and [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'solidus_paypal_braintree/factories'
```
