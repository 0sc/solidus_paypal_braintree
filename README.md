SolidusPaypalBraintree
======================

Introduction goes here.

Installation
------------

Add solidus_paypal_braintree to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_paypal_braintree'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g solidus_paypal_braintree:install
```

Apple Pay
---------

### Setup
Braintree has some [excellent documentation](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/apple-pay/configuration/javascript/v3) on what you'll need to do to get Apple Pay up and running.

In order to make everything a little simpler, this extension includes some client-side code to get you started. Specifically, it provides some wrappers to help with the initialization of an Apple Pay session. The following is a relatively bare-bones implementation:
```javascript
var applePayButton = document.getElementById('your-apple-pay-button');
window.SolidusPaypalBraintree.fetchToken(function(clientToken) {
  window.SolidusPaypalBraintree.initialize(clientToken, function(braintreeClient) {
    window.SolidusPaypalBraintree.setupApplePay(braintreeClient, "YOUR-MERCHANT-ID", funtion(applePayInstance) {
      applePayButton.addEventListener('click', function() { beginApplePayCheckout(applePayInstance) });
    }
  }
}

beginApplePayCheckout = function(applePayInstance) {
  window.SolidusPaypalBraintree.initializeApplePaySession({
    applePayInstance: applePayInstance,
    storeName: 'Your Store Name',
    currentUserEmail: Spree.current_email,
    paymentMethodId: Spree.braintreePaymentMethodId,
  }, (session) => {
    // Add in your logic for onshippingcontactselected and onshippingmethodselected.
  }
};
```

For additional information checkout the [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/reference/applepayjs/) and [Braintree's documentation](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/apple-pay/client-side/javascript/v3).

### Development
Developing with Apple Pay has a few gotchas. First and foremost, you'll need to ensure you have access to a device running iOS 10+. (I've heard there's also been progress on adding support to the Simulator.)

Next, you'll need an Apple Pay sandbox account. You can check out Apple's [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/support/apple-pay-sandbox/) for additional help in performing this step.

Finally, Apple Pay requires the site to be served via HTTPS. I recommend setting up a proxy server to help solve this. There are [lots of guides](https://www.google.ca/search?q=nginx+reverse+proxy+ssl+localhost) on how this can be achieved.

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs, and [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'solidus_paypal_braintree/factories'
```
